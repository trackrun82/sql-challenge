# sql-challenge

- This challenge utilized 6 CSV files from the 1980s and 1990s to analyze employee records

## Data Modeling
- An ERD was formed to show the relationships between each CSV
- The ERD was transformed into Physical form

## Data Engineering
- This was used to create tables within a database in PostGreSql
- Each CSV was then imported into the created tables

## Data Analysis
- Specific queries were run on the data to show different relationships

## Bonus
- Data was displayed graphically to investigate further
